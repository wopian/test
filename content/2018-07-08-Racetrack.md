## Introduction

![Once upon a time, I made a racetrack.](https://i.imgur.com/tsPfTwi.jpg)

It was made for Blacktop (my work in progress magnum opus), and I entered it into a racetrack contest on /r/Racetrackdesigns.
The layout sucked (I'm still uncertain what makes a good racetrack), but the presentation was appreciated.

So much so, that someone on Reddit decided to (almost a year after I made the track) send me a message, asking me for my workflow.
I like sharing the way I do things. Knowledge should be shared as much as possible, so here we are. Reddit person, this is for you, and anyone else who might be interested.

## Blender

I hope you're familiar with Blender, if not, please follow [this tutorial series by BornCG on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY6KPrc4uMw&list=PLda3VoSoc_TR7X7wfblBGiRz-bvhKpGkS). It's a very good tutorial series on learning Blender.
The most important things I use in Blender are:

- Nurbs Paths
- Array modifiers (with start and end caps)
- Assigning multiple materials to a model
- Loop cuts (CTRL-R)
- Loop selects (ALT-RMB)
- Proportional editing mode
- Sculpt mode

With all that said, let's move on to my actual workflow:
